# Computer Performance Analysis
Date: December 30, 2025

## SUMMARY
Your computer is running slowly primarily due to:
1. **CRITICAL: Disk is 91% full** - only 21 GB free out of 237 GB
2. **Duplicate antivirus software** - Both McAfee AND Windows Defender running
3. **Heavy background software load** - Many unnecessary programs consuming resources

---

## SYSTEM SPECS
- CPU: Intel Core i7-9750H @ 2.60GHz (6 cores, 12 threads)
- RAM: 32 GB total, ~16.5 GB free (48% usage - acceptable)
- Disk: 237 GB total, only 21 GB free (91% full - CRITICAL)
- Current CPU load: 4% (low)

---

## TOP ISSUES (in order of impact)

### 1. DISK NEARLY FULL (91% used)
This is likely your biggest problem. Windows needs free disk space for:
- Virtual memory / page file
- System updates
- Temporary files
- Search indexing

**RECOMMENDATION:** Free up at least 30-50 GB of space. Target having 15-20% free.
- Run Disk Cleanup (search "Disk Cleanup" in Start menu)
- Uninstall games/programs you don't use
- Move large files to external storage
- Clear Downloads folder

### 2. DUPLICATE ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE
You have BOTH McAfee AND Windows Defender running simultaneously:

**McAfee processes (using ~95 MB combined):**
- McAMTaskAgent.exe
- McCSPServiceHost.exe
- mcshield.exe
- McSmtFwk.exe
- McUICnt.exe
- MfeAVSvc.exe
- mfefire.exe
- mfemms.exe
- mfevtps.exe

**Windows Defender processes (using ~420 MB combined):**
- MsMpEng.exe (398 MB alone!)
- MpDefenderCoreService.exe
- NisSrv.exe
- SecurityHealthService.exe

**RECOMMENDATION:** Uninstall McAfee. Windows Defender is sufficient and less resource-intensive.

### 3. HP BLOATWARE
Multiple HP utilities running that you likely don't need:
- HPAudioSwitch.exe (60 MB)
- HPCommRecovery.exe (13 MB)
- HPDisplayCenter.exe (87 MB)
- HPMediaNetwork.exe (64 MB)
- HPSystemEventUtilityBackground.exe (60 MB)
- HPSystemEventUtilityHost.exe (40 MB)
- HPPrintScanDoctorService.exe (9 MB)
- OmenCommandCenterBackground.exe (64 MB)
- OmenInstallMonitor.exe (45 MB)
- Various SR*.exe services (~160 MB combined)

Total: ~600+ MB of HP bloatware

**RECOMMENDATION:** Uninstall HP programs you don't use from "Add or Remove Programs"

### 4. LOGITECH TUNE EXCESSIVE PROCESSES
LogiTune is running 7+ separate processes using ~660 MB combined:
- LogiTune.exe (multiple instances)
- LogiTuneAgent.exe
- LogiTuneUpdater.exe

**RECOMMENDATION:** Close LogiTune when not adjusting webcam/headset settings, or set it not to start automatically

### 5. ADOBE CREATIVE CLOUD OVERHEAD
Multiple Adobe background processes even when not using Adobe apps:
- Adobe Desktop Service.exe (133 MB)
- Creative Cloud.exe (120 MB)
- Creative Cloud UI Helper.exe (multiple instances, ~485 MB combined)
- CoreSync.exe (56 MB)
- CCXProcess.exe
- AdobeIPCBroker.exe

Total: ~800+ MB

**RECOMMENDATION:** If not actively using Adobe apps, close Creative Cloud from the system tray

### 6. EPIC GAMES LAUNCHER (215 MB)
Running in background even when not gaming.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Close when not gaming, or disable "Run when my computer starts" in Epic settings

---

## STARTUP PROGRAMS TO DISABLE
Go to Task Manager > Startup tab and disable:
- Epic Games Launcher (unless you need auto-updates)
- Steam (can launch manually)
- Docker Desktop (if not using Docker)
- Logitech Download Assistant
- HP System Event Utility (unless using HP-specific features)

---

## QUICK WINS (do these first)
1. Run Disk Cleanup with "Clean up system files" option
2. Uninstall McAfee (Windows Defender is enough)
3. Close Adobe Creative Cloud from system tray
4. Close Epic Games Launcher
5. Disable unnecessary startup programs
6. Restart computer

---

## WHAT'S ACTUALLY FINE
- RAM usage (48%) is acceptable for 32 GB
- CPU usage (4%) is very low
- Node.js processes are normal for development work
- Windows core processes are normal

---

## ESTIMATED MEMORY SAVINGS
If you follow recommendations:
- Uninstall McAfee: ~100 MB
- Close HP bloatware: ~600 MB
- Close LogiTune: ~660 MB
- Close Adobe CC: ~800 MB
- Close Epic: ~215 MB
- **Total potential savings: ~2.4 GB RAM**

More importantly, freeing disk space will have the biggest impact on overall system responsiveness.
